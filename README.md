# yxwm
A tiny (~67 loc) tiling window manager for X11 with a big focus on a lightweight, stripped down environment. It supports basic functionalities like open a terminal, format the size of the windows as well as manage the aspect ratio between them in a clean way. The windows are organized with a master window on the left and a window stack of the other windows on the right side of the screen (like the dwm standard configuration).

*Note: The wm is still experimental at this point. Therefore, I would not recommend using yxwm as a window manager for everyday use due to the rather low functional scope.*

## Start yxwm

## Configuration
You can configure yxwm in the [config.h](https://github.com/Flederossi/yxwm/blob/main/src/include/config.h) file. Every option is described with a small comment. After configuring the variables, yxwm should be recompiled.
